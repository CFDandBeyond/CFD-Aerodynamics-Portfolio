# CFD & Aerodynamics Project Portfolio

This repository presents a selection of my Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Aerodynamics projects.  
It demonstrates my skills in **CFD modelling, turbulence analysis, FEA, structural optimisation, and validation** across aerospace, energy, and automotive domains.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects
1. **Erosion Mitigation in Oil & Gas Pipelines (Masterâ€™s Thesis)**  
   - 2D axisymmetric CFD study of Submerged Impingement Jets (SIJ).  
   - Achieved 90% erosion reduction for 50 Î¼m particles and by 44% for 300 Î¼m particles.  
   

2. **Prototype Design of Amazon Delivery Drone**  
   - Tiltrotor eVTOL drone frame optimised with hybrid composites.  
   - Reduced stress levels to ~11% of material limits.  

3. **Aeroplane Wing Flow Control Analysis**  
   - NACA 84-M aerofoil with slot flow control.  
   - Results validated within 10% of Knight & Bamberâ€™s experiments.  

4. **Exhaust Manifold Flow & Thermal Optimisation**  
   - Inline-four engine manifold redesign.  
   - Reduced backpressure by 7% and wall temperatures by 12%.  

5. **External Flow Past a Cylinder**  
   - CFD study at Re = 3900 with mesh independence validation.  
   - Compared with Kravchenko LES data and inviscid solution.
